## Summary
In conclusion, I would recommend 3 different ways we can change some of the large disparities.
- We can add incentives to Rural and Suburban drivers so we can meet more ride requests.
- We can tell Urban drivers that if they drive to more Rural areas they could receive more money.
- Add surge rates to Urban cities to increase Average Fare per Ride, which would increase revenue.
